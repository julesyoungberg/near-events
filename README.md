# `near-events`

This is a sample event ticketing application on the near blockchain.

## Contracts

This repository includes 2 simple style contracts that make up the application. The event contract represents a single event. It stores information about the host, guests, and tickets. The factory contract is the main contract which clients / users can use to create and find events.


## Usage

### Getting started

(see below for video recordings of each of the following steps)

INSTALL `NEAR CLI` first like this: `npm i -g near-cli`

1. clone this repo to a local folder
2. run `npm ci`
3. run `./scripts/1.dev-deploy.sh`
4. run `./scripts/2.use-contract.sh`
5. run `./scripts/2.use-contract.sh` (yes, run it to see changes)
6. run `./scripts/3.cleanup.sh`

### Videos

**`1.dev-deploy.sh`**

This video shows the build and deployment of the contract.

**`2.use-contract.sh`**

This video shows contract methods being called. You should run the script twice to see the effect it has on contract state.

**`3.cleanup.sh`**

This video shows the cleanup script running. Make sure you add the `BENEFICIARY` environment variable. The script will remind you if you forget.

```sh
export BENEFICIARY=<your-account-here>   # this account receives contract account balance
```

### Other documentation

- See `./scripts/README.md` for documentation about the scripts
- Watch this video where Willem Wyndham walks us through refactoring a simple example of a NEAR smart contract written in AssemblyScript

  https://youtu.be/QP7aveSqRPo

  ```
  There are 2 "styles" of implementing AssemblyScript NEAR contracts:
  - the contract interface can either be a collection of exported functions
  - or the contract interface can be the methods of a an exported class

  We call the second style "Singleton" because there is only one instance of the class which is serialized to the blockchain storage.  Rust contracts written for NEAR do this by default with the contract struct.
